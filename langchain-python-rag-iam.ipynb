    "\n",
    "To reduce risks associated with public access to your application, you can require users to sign in. After authentication, the user’s ID can be used to retrieve the authorization policies stored in AuthZ.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can easily add login functionality to your application using the [AuthN](https://pangea.cloud/services/authn/) service. It allows users to sign in to the Pangea-hosted authorization server using their browser. Your application will then perform an authorization code flow using the Pangea SDK you’ve already imported to communicate with the AuthZ service. For demonstration purposes, we will use Flask as the client server.\n",

    "\n",
    "If you are on the AuthZ page, navigate to the list of services by clicking **Back to Main Menu** in the top left corner. This will return you to the project page in your Pangea User Console, where enabled services will be marked with a green dot.\n",
